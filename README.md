# OpenMarket

A public good NFT Marketplace.

## Why

Royalties are dead. Leading marketplaces have offchain orderbooks and we have to
beg for API keys like it's web 2.0.

We can kill two birds with one stone:

- Online marketplace
- Public good: No marketplace fee ever, no admins.
- Fully onchain orderbook

## Goals

- Sell NFT: less than 100k gas **done**
- Buy NFT: less than 100k gas **done**

## Properties

- No admin key and no governance
