          <h3>NFT Royalties Are Dead</h3>
          <p>
            The major marketplaces such as Blur, OpenSea, and Magic Eden have
            recently stopped enforcing NFT royalties as standard. This
            zero-royalty battle has killed the model that allowed creators to
            release NFTs for free or at a low cost and earn royalties.

          <h3>Off-Chain Order Books</h3>
          <p>
            Leading NFT platforms have implemented off-chain order books that
            are not publicly accessible. To integrate with these marketplaces,
            projects have to request API keys, like in web 2.0, and the approval
            process can take several months.

          <h3>Limited Distribution</h3>
          <p>
            The existing NFT marketplaces have positioned themselves as "the
            distributors" of NFT collections. They decide on the rules, service
            fees, access to data and so on.
